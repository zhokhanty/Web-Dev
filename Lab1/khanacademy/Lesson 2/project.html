        <h1>Travel to Hainan</h1>

                The world of monkeys</strong></em> and to eat chinese food.</p>

     <h2>Chinese cuisine</h2>
     <p>There are specific culinary characteristics characteristic of people of different social classes and nationalities.
         The most famous Chinese dishes are <strong><em class="red">Peking duck, century egg, and etc.</em></strong>.</p>
     <h4>Peking duck</h4>

      alt="The meat is characterized by its thin, crispy skin, with authentic versions of the dish serving mostly the skin and little meat, 
      sliced in front of the diners by the cook. Delicious!">
     <h4>Century egg</h4>
     <img src="https://avatars.mds.yandex.net/i?id=19f4b23c76e720d3d4d517c9ce2f348249bc0193-5284061-images-thumbs&n=13"
      alt="Through the process, the yolk becomes a dark green to grey color,
       with a creamy consistency and strong flavor due to the hydrogen sulfide and ammonia present, 
       while the white becomes a dark brown, translucent jelly with a salty flavor. It's very awful food for me.">
